# vtes-crypt-optimizer

Simulates crypt draws in the game [Vampire: the Eternal Struggle](http://www.vekn.net/what-is-v-tes) and checks for the goodness of the results in respect to predefined goodness metric.

The approach has been chosen so as for it to be generally useful with modification of the available crypt cards and target function. The particular crypt optimization with the possible crypt choices and desirabilities of their combinations has to do with the CrimethInc-driven tap-and-bleed deck that I played in the national championships of Finland and Sweden in the 2018, making the finals in both.
